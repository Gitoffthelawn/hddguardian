From this panel you can execute the built-in tests available on the selected device. These tests are: 
 # offline data collection; 
 # short test; 
 # long test; 
 # conveyance (portable devices only). 
When you select a test, you see the estimated duration of test (variable if device is busy with other operations) and a description of selected test.

You can execute only one test at time for each device.

For more information about device's tests, you should see the [http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/S.M.A.R.T.montools/wiki/TocDoc#S.M.A.R.T.Testing smartctl manual].

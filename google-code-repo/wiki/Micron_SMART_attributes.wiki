=== Attributes table ===
|| *ID* || *Hex* || *Name* || *Description* ||
||01||01||Raw Read Error Rate||The data field holds the raw sum of correctable and uncorrectable ECC (error-correcting code) error events over  the life of the drive. If this ever exceeds 4.294.967.295, this value will wrap around.||
||05||05||Re-Allocated Block Count||This value gives the total bad block count of the drive minus the number of one-time programmable (OTP) bad blocks.||
||09||09||Power-On Hours Count||This value gives the raw number of hours that the device has been online over its life.||
||12||0C||Power Cycle Count||This value gives the raw number of power cycle events that this drive has experienced.||
||170||AA||New Failing Block Count||This value gives the total bad block count of the drive minus the number of one-time programmable (OTP) bad blocks.||
||171||AB||Program Fail Count||This value contains the raw number of flash program failure events. If this value ever would exceed 65,535, it will stay at 65,535.||
||172||AC||Erase Fail Count||This value contains the raw number of flash erase failure events. If this value ever would exceed 65,535, it will stay at 65,535.||
||173||AD||Block Wear Leveling Count / Average Block Erase Count||Average erase count of all good blocks.||
||174||AE||Unexpected Power Loss Count||The total number of times that the device has been power cycled unexpectedly.||
||181||B5||Non-4K Aligned Access Count||This attribute contains two values: the low order 16 bits of the raw data contain the total unaligned reads counter, divided by 60,000, with a ceiling value of 65,535; the high order 16 bits of the raw data contain the total unaligned writes counter, divided by 60,000, with a ceiling value of 65,535.||
||183||B7||SATA Interface Downshift||At completion of speed negotiation between host and device, the firmware records the value of the newly negotiated speed. This value is compared to the previously recorded value; if the new value is lower than the previous, a downshift has occurred and the downshift counter is incremented.||
||187||BB||Reported Uncorrectable Errors||This value is the total number of ECC (error-correcting code) correction failures reported by the sequencer.||
||188||BC||Command Timeouts||This counter is incremented by the number of outstanding commands when the host issues a soft reset, host reset, or a comreset. The raw data holds the value of this counter. If it ever exceeds 4.294.967.295, it will wrap around.||
||189||BD||Factory Bad Block Count||One-time programmable (OTP) bad block count.||
||196||C4||Reallocation Event Count||This value gives the total bad block count of the drive minus the number of one-time programmable (OTP) bad blocks.||
||197||C5||Current Pending Sector Count||Will always be 0 because reallocation will be done on the fly.||
||198||C6||SMART Off-Line Scan Uncorrectable Error Count||Uncorrectable errors detected during SMART off-line scan.||
||199||C7||Ultra DMA CRC Error Rate||Gives the number of captured FIS interface general CRC (cyclic redundancy check) errors over the life of the drive, for both reads and writes, since the most recent power cycle. If this counter ever reaches 4.294.967.295, it will wrap around.||
||202||CA||Percentage Lifetime Used||The average erase count of all blocks on Channel 0 CE 0 divided by the specified !MaxEraseCount (10k for MLC or 100k for SLC), reported as a percentage from 0 to 100%.||
||206||CE||Write Error Rate||Report the number of program failures divided by 60,000. If the value ever reaches 65,535, it will remain there thereafter.||

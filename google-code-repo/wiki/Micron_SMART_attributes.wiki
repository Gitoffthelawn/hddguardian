=== Attributes table ===
|| *ID* || *Hex* || *Name* || *Description* ||
||01||01||Raw Read Error Rate||The data field holds the raw sum of correctable and uncorrectable ECC (error-correcting code) error events over  the life of the drive. If this ever exceeds 4.294.967.295, this value will wrap around.||
||05||05||Re-Allocated Block Count||This value gives the total bad block count of the drive minus the number of one-time programmable (OTP) bad blocks.||
||05||05||Reallocated Sector Count||The total number of reallocated sectors.||
||05||05||Reallocated NAND Block Count||The total number of reallocated blocks.||
||09||09||Power-On Hours Count||This value gives the raw number of hours that the device has been online over its life.||
||12||0C||Power Cycle Count||This value gives the raw number of power cycle events that this drive has experienced.||
||170||AA||New Failing Block Count||This value gives the total bad block count of the drive minus the number of one-time programmable (OTP) bad blocks.||
||170||AA||Reserved Block Count||This value gives the total bad block count of the drive minus the number of one-time programmable (OTP) bad blocks.||
||171||AB||Program Fail Count||This value contains the raw number of flash program failure events. If this value ever would exceed 65,535, it will stay at 65,535.||
||172||AC||Erase Fail Count||This value contains the raw number of flash erase failure events. If this value ever would exceed 65,535, it will stay at 65,535.||
||173||AD||Block Wear Leveling Count||Average erase count of all good blocks.||
||173||AD||Average Block-Erase Count||This value is the average erase count of all super blocks. One super block is defined to include all the physical blocks with the same block number of all planes.||
||174||AE||Unexpected Power Loss Count||The total number of times that the device has been power cycled unexpectedly.||
||181||B5||Non-4K Aligned Access Count||This attribute contains two values: the low order 16 bits of the raw data contain the total unaligned reads counter, divided by 60,000, with a ceiling value of 65,535; the high order 16 bits of the raw data contain the total unaligned writes counter, divided by 60,000, with a ceiling value of 65,535.||
||180||B4||Unused Reserve (Spare) NAND Blocks||The raw value of this attribute gives the count of unused reserved blocks.||
||181||B5||Unaligned Access Count||This attribute provides data that is tracked by Micron engineering. It is not indicative of SSD wear or of impending failure.||
||183||B7||SATA Interface Downshift||At completion of speed negotiation between host and device, the firmware records the value of the newly negotiated speed. This value is compared to the previously recorded value; if the new value is lower than the previous, a downshift has occurred and the downshift counter is incremented.||
||184||B8||Error Correction Count||This value is the count of end-to-end correction events.||
||187||BB||Reported Uncorrectable Errors||This value is the total number of ECC (error-correcting code) correction failures reported by the sequencer.||
||188||BC||Command Timeouts||This counter is incremented by the number of outstanding commands when the host issues a soft reset, host reset, or a comreset. The raw data holds the value of this counter. If it ever exceeds 4.294.967.295, it will wrap around.||
||188||BC||Command Timeout Count||This value is the total number of command timeouts. This attribute tracks the number of command timeouts as defined by an active command being interrupted by a reset or another command.||
||189||BD||Factory Bad Block Count||One-time programmable (OTP) bad block count.||
||194||C2||Enclosure Temperature||This value report the current device temperature.||
||195||C3||Cumulative Corrected ECC||This attribute provides data that is tracked by Micron engineering. It is not indicative of SSD wear or of impending failure.||
||196||C4||Reallocation Event Count||This value gives the total bad block count of the drive minus the number of one-time programmable (OTP) bad blocks.||
||197||C5||Current Pending Sector Count||This value gives the number of blocks waiting to be remapped.||
||198||C6||SMART Off-Line Scan Uncorrectable Error Count||Uncorrectable errors detected during SMART off-line scan.||
||198||C6||SMART Off-line Scan Uncorrectable Sector Count||This value is the cumulative number of unrecoverable read errors found in a background media scan. If no background media scan has been run, a value of 0 will be returned.||
||199||C7||Ultra DMA CRC Error Rate||Gives the number of captured FIS (frame information structure) interface general CRC (cyclic redundancy check) errors over the life of the drive, for both reads and writes, since the most recent power cycle. If this counter ever reaches 4.294.967.295, it will wrap around.||
||199||C7||Ultra-DMA CRC Error Count||This value is the cumulative number of FIS (frame information structure) interface general CRC (cycle redundancy check) error counts over the life of the drive, for both reads and writes, since the most recent power cycle.||
||202||CA||Percentage Lifetime Used||The average erase count of all blocks on Channel 0 CE 0 divided by the specified !MaxEraseCount (10k for MLC or 100k for SLC), reported as a percentage from 0 to 100%.||
||202||CA||Percent Lifetime Remaining||The normalized value reports the remaining life on device, reported as a percentage from 100 to 0%.||
||206||CE||Write Error Rate||Report the number of program failures divided by 60,000. If the value ever reaches 65,535, it will remain there thereafter.||
||210||D2||Successful RAIN Recovery Count||The total number of TUs successfully recovered by RAIN (redundant array of independent NAND).||
||246||F6||Total Host Sector Writes||The total number of sectors written by the host.||
||247||F7||Contact Factory||Contact factory for details.||
||248||F8||Contact Factory||Contact factory for details.||

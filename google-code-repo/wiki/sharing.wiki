HDD Guardian can export and import smartctl devices outputs. In a context of local area network is possible for the system administrator to monitor all disks of the computers in the LAN.

To share local drives, you must select a destination folder where HDD Guardian will save these outputs after the set refresh timing is expired. You can also select the local disks you want to share into the [enable_disable_features Enable/disable features] of Main section.

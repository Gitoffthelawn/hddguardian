HDD Guardian can export and import smartctl devices outputs. In a context of local area network is possible for the system administrator to monitor all disks of the computers in the LAN.

To share local drives, you must select a destination folder where HDD Guardian will save these outputs after the set refresh timing is expired. You can also select the local disks you want to share into the [enable_disable_features Enable/disable features] of Main section.

From version 0.4.0.0 you can also create a summary output of devices in Xml format. This can be useful for desktop customization tools like [http://rainmeter.net/cms/ Rainmeter]: you can parse Xml content and put the result into a skin directly into your desktop.
For a better control of this option is possible to set the output folder. The name of output file is "hddguardian.xml".

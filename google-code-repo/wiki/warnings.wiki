Here you can set the behavior of HDD Guardian about some vital parameters of hard disk devices.

The user can be alert in case of imminent failure of device if smartctl reports that the unit fails to pass all threshold of S.M.A.R.T. attributes.

Another vital parameter for hard disk drives (but not for solid state disks) is the temperature: when we have a too high value (above 50Â°C), HDD Guardian display a warning; user is notified also if the unit is close to that threshold.

=== Attributes table ===

|| *ID* || *Hex* || *Name* || *Description* ||
||01||01||Read Error Rate||Indicates the rate of hardware read errors that occurred when reading data from a disk surface.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup> The raw value has different structure for different vendors and is often not meaningful as a decimal number.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 3]</sup>||
||02||02||Throughput Performance||Overall (general) throughput performance of a hard disk drive. If the value of this attribute is decreasing there is a high probability that there is a problem with the disk.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||
||03||03||Spin-Up Time||Average time (in milliseconds or seconds) of spindle spin up (from zero RPM - Revolutions Per Minute - to fully operational).<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||04||04||Start/Stop Count||Indicates a count of hard disk spindle start/stop cycles.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||05||05||Reallocated Sectors Count||Count of reallocated sectors (1 sector = 512 bytes). When the hard drive finds a read/write/verification error, it marks this sector as "reallocated" and transfers data to a special reserved area (spare area). This process is also known as remapping and "reallocated" sectors are called remaps. This is why, on modern hard disks, "bad blocks" cannot be found while testing the surface - all bad blocks are hidden in reallocated sectors. However, the more sectors that are reallocated, the more read/write speed will decrease.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||
||06||06||Read Channel Margin||Indicates a margin of a channel while reading data. Usually manufacturers do not use this parameter.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||07||07||Seek Error Rate||Rate of seek errors of the magnetic heads. If there is a failure in the mechanical positioning system, a servo damage or a thermal widening of the hard disk, seek errors arise. More seek errors indicates a worsening condition of a disk surface and the mechanical subsystem.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||
||08||08||Seek Time Performance||Average performance of seek operations of the magnetic heads. If this attribute is decreasing, it is a sign of problems in the mechanical subsystem.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||
||09||09||Power-On Hours (POH)||Indicates a count of hours in power-on state. The value of this attribute shows total count of hours (or minutes, or seconds, depending on manufacturer) in power-on state. A decrease of this attribute value to the critical level (threshold) indicates a decrease of the MTBF (Mean Time Between Failures).<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||10||0A||Spin Retry Count||Count of retry of spin start attempts. This attribute stores a total count of the spin start attempts to reach the fully operational speed under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). An increase of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||
||11||0B||Recalibration Retries||This attribute indicates the number of times recalibration was requested (under the condition that the first attempt was unsuccessful). A decrease of this attribute value is a sign of problems in the hard disk mechanical subsystem.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||
||12||0C||Power Cycle Count ||Is an informational parameter and indicates the count of full hard disk power on/off cycles.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||13||0D||Soft Read Error Rate||Uncorrected read errors reported to the operating system. If the value is non-zero, you should back up your data.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||

||184||B9||Head Stability||Western Digital attribute.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||186||BA||Induced Op-Vibration Detection||Western Digital attribute.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||

||188||BC||Command Timeout||The count of aborted operations due to HDD timeout. Normally this attribute value should be equal to zero and if the value is far above zero, then most likely there will be some serious problems with power supply or an oxidized data cable.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 4]</sup>||
||189||BD||High Fly Writes||HDD producers implement a Fly Height Monitor that attempts to provide additional protections for write operations by detecting when a recording head is flying outside its normal operating range. If an unsafe fly height condition is encountered, the write process is stopped, and the information is rewritten or reallocated to a safe region of the hard drive. This attribute indicates the count of these errors detected over the lifetime of the drive.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 4]</sup>||
||190||BE||Airflow Temperature||Airflow temperature on Western Digital HDs (Same as temperature 194, but current value is 50 less).<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||

||196||C4||Reallocation Event Count||This parameter indicates a count of remap operations (transferring data from a bad sector to a special reserved disk area - spare area). The raw value of this attribute shows the total number of attempts to transfer data from reallocated sectors to a spare area. Unsuccessful attempts are counted as well as successful. Since this is a count value, it can only increase.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||197||C5||Current Pending Sector Count ||This parameter is a critical parameter and indicates the current count of unstable sectors (waiting for remapping). The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of sectors waiting for remapping.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup> Read errors on the sector will not remap the sector, it will only be remapped on a failed write attempt. This can be problematic to test because cached writes will not remap the sector, only direct I/O writes to the disk.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup> Later, when some of these sectors are read successfully, the value is decreased. If errors still occur when reading some sector, the hard drive will try to restore the data, transfer it to the reserved disk area (spare area) and mark this sector as remapped.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup>||
||198||C6||Uncorrectable Sector Count||This parameter is a critical parameter and indicates the quantity of uncorrectable errors. The raw value of this attribute indicates the total number of uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 2]</sup> A rise in the value of this attribute indicates defects of the disk surface and/or problems in the mechanical subsystem.<sup>[HDD_SMART_attributes#Sources 1]</sup>||
||199||C7||UltraDMA CRC Error Count||This parameter indicates the total quantity of CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) errors during UltraDMA mode.

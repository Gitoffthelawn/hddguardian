 # http://hddguardian.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/some-problems.png when the shield of the basic icon become red, means that at least one device is failing;
 # http://hddguardian.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/update-ok.png this is a variation of the basic icon: all devices are in a good state, and a new version of HDD Guardian is available;
 # http://hddguardian.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/update-ko.png this icon reports that a new version of HDD Guardian is available, but at  least one device is failing.

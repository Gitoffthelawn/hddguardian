= Virtual devices =

HDD Guardian offer the possibility to monitor other devices that are not connected with a PC sharing smartctl output into a specified folder.
This folder can be selected into the “Sharing” panel of “Settings” section; when the refresh rate expires, HDD Guardian automatically save a copy of smartctl output for all local devices that have their sharing option enabled.

The steps to follow for activate the sharing option are:
 # go to “Settings” section, select the “Sharing” and then select the output folder. When a folder is selected successfully, HDD Guardian automatically save their path;
 # go to “Main” section and then select “[enable_disable_features Enable/disable features]”. In the lower part of this panel we have the “Monitoring features”. Clicking on “Share smartctl device output”, you enable HDD Guardian to save a copy of the last output into the previous specified folder. This is a per-device setting, which means that you can check the sharing capability for each device installed into your computer.

To add a virtual device, simply right click into the devices list and then select “Add virtual device”.

To remove a virtual device, select it, right click and then select “Remove virtual device”.

The S.M.A.R.T. settings, the “run test” capability, the device tray icon and also other settings are not available for virtual devices because HDD Guardian (and smartctl) doesn't have a direct access to these fake devices.

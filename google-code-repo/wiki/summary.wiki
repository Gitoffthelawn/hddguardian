The summary panel displays health basics about selected device: temperature, last test result, overall health, bad sector and error information, the last update and eventual warnings about firmware updates.

At panel's left bottom we have an area where you can see the OS (a) and manufacturer logos (b), plus the nationality flag of manufacturer (c); the other two icons represents respectively the operating modality of HDD Guardian (d) and the user rights (e).

The modality varies in base of media where HDD Guardian is stored: if is stored into a fixed device the icons is a PC tower, and all function are available; otherwise if is stored into a removable media, HDD Guardian switch automatically into portable mode, appears an USB stick and some functions are not available.

The fingerprint icon varies in base of user rights: if is an administrator the program works with full functionality and the fingerprint is green; otherwise some functions are not available (like USB detection, that is disabled) and the fingerprint appear colored in red.

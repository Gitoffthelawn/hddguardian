The list displays the S.M.A.R.T. parameters for selected device, indicating for each attribute: 
 # if the value has fallen below the threshold limit value. There are three indicators: 
  * the green bullet means that the value has never fallen below the limit; 
  * the red bullet means that the value is now fallen below the threshold limit; 
  * the yellow bullet means that the value has fallen below the limit in the past, but now the value is above the threshold; 
  * the magenta bullet means that the value has never fallen below the limit, but the raw value is greater than zero (available only for critical values);
 # identification number; 
 # name; 
 # the current value; 
 # the worst ever recorded value over the life of the unit; 
 # the threshold value, beyond which is likely imminent failure; 
 # the raw value (generally are counters).

Clicking on the attributes listed you can also see the related "flags" and the comparing chart of current value, the worst and the threshold.
The "flags" values are:
 * "Prefailure Warning": indicates a device vital attribute; 
 * "Updated Online": attribute value is updated during the execution of online testing; 
 * "Speed / Performance": attribute value reflects the performance of disk; 
 * "Error Rate": attribute value reflects the relative frequency of errors on the parameter; 
 * "Event Count": attribute is a counter of events; 
 * "Self-preserving": attribute value is updated and saved automatically.

Each attribute can check one or more "flags".

The list also, depending on the case, display different colors for the values:
 * normal (system color): the value has never fallen below the threshold and the raw value is zero; 
 * <font color="#ff1493">deep pink</font>: the current value has never fallen below the limit, but the raw value is greater than zero; 
 * <font color="#b22222">red brick</font>: the current value is currently below the limit; 
 * <font color="#ff8c00">orange</font>: the current value has fallen below the limit in the past but is now above the threshold value. 

Clicking the link “Hide/show attribute info” you can see some informations about selected attribute, like a little description of their function, if the attribute indicates a pre-failure or a device's old aging and if it is update continuously or only during offline tests.

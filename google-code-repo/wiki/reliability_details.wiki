Into this section is possible to see details about device health: they're two sections, one for hard disk and one for SSD.

For hard disk devices are rated four values critical for their health:
 * errors count;
 * reallocated sector count (bad blocks);
 * current pending sectors;
 * offline uncorrectable.
Is possible to set a different threshold for each of these values (except for bad blocks) into the [rating Reliability] tab in the Settings section.

For SSD devices are rated the vendor-specific S.M.A.R.T. attributes.
